spacecrypt
==========

Combination of alphabetical encryption methods that encrypts spaces

## Description ##

This is `spacecrypt 1.0`, just a simple idea from a young French student (that's me) after his arithmetic class.

The goal is to create an encryption method with an alphabetic password that memorizes spaces.

I tried to make my code organized and light. If you find errors or optimization problems (which is likely), please tell me at <hemispace@outlook.com>

## Requirements ##

- gcc ([MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/))

## Installing ##

Run `compile.bat`.

## Usage ##

`input.txt` contains the text to encrypt/decrypt
(if it doesn't exist yet, run the program, select '1' in the menu, type 'y' to confirm and close when asked for password)

PLEASE respect these simple syntax rules:
- FOR ENCRYPTION: Type only in lower case letter, no special characters, one space between words, no spaces after last words, new lines are allowed instead of spaces when you want
- FOR DECRYPTION: Never try to decrypt random text, surprising results, only decrypt text chains that have been encrypted by this program
do not jump line or insert spaces for this method.

## How it works ##

Coming soon, you can still read source code.
