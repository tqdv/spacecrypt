# spacecrpyt
Combinaison of alphabet encryption methods that encrypt spaces

Disclaimer: gcc required to compile the project (easy with MinGW http://www.mingw.org/)

This is spacecrypt 1.0, just a simple idea of a young french student (that's me) after its arithmetic class
The goal is to create an encryption method with an alphabetic password that memorize spaces, more details. 
I'm not used to comment my own code, moreover my english is not perfect, but I hope you'll understand
what I did, I tried to make my code organized and lighten, if you find errors or optimisation problems which is probable,
please tell me hemispace@outlook.com

UTILISATION GUIDE:
First you have to compile the project. GCC REQUIRED!!! To do so just run compile.bat 
if you're on windows and if gcc is accessible from path varibles, if not, look on the web if you need help

Now this is simple, you put your text you want to encrypt or decrypt in input.txt
(if it does not exist yet, try run the program enter '1' in meny type 'y' to confirm and close when ask for password)
PLEASE just respect theese simple syntax rules:
- FOR ENCRYPTION: Type only in lower case letter, no spacial characters, one spaces between words, no spaces after last words, 
new lines are allowed instead of spaces when you want
- FOR DECRYPTION: Do never try to decrypt random text, surprising results, only decrypt text chains that have been encrypted by this program
do not jump line or insert spaces for this method.

DETAILED FUNCTIONNING:
Coming soon, you can still read source code.
